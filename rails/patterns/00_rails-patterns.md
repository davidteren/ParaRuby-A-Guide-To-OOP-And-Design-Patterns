## Rails Patterns


Active Record pattern: This pattern is used to implement the models in a Rails application. It provides an interface for accessing and manipulating data stored in a database, making it easy to create, read, update, and delete records.
Adapter pattern: This pattern allows you to adapt the interface of one class to match the interface expected by another class, making it easy to integrate existing code into new systems.
Bridge pattern: This pattern allows you to separate the interface of a class from its implementation, making it easy to change the implementation without affecting the rest of the code. This is often used in Rails to provide different implementations of a particular feature, such as a different way of rendering a view.
Builder pattern: This pattern allows you to construct complex objects by specifying their parts step by step, rather than creating them all at once. This is often used in Rails to build complex HTML documents or other output.
Chain of Responsibility pattern: This pattern allows you to create a chain of objects that can handle a request, with each object deciding whether or not to pass the request on to the next object in the chain. This is often used in Rails to handle requests in a modular, flexible way.
Command pattern: This pattern allows you to create objects that represent actions or operations, making it easy to implement undo/redo functionality or to queue up actions for later execution.
Composite pattern: This pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way, making it easy to work with complex object hierarchies. This is often used in Rails to create complex data structures, such as trees or graphs.
Convention over configuration pattern: This pattern is used throughout Rails to provide default behavior for common tasks, so that developers don't have to specify everything explicitly. This makes it faster and easier to develop applications, but also allows for customization when needed.
Decorator pattern: This pattern allows you to add new behavior to an existing object without modifying its class. This is often used in Rails to add additional functionality to existing models or controllers.
Dependency injection pattern: This pattern is used in Rails to manage the dependencies between different parts of the application. It allows components to be easily swapped out or replaced, making it easier to test and maintain the code.
Facade pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to use. This is often used in Rails to provide a simple, consistent API for accessing different parts of the framework.
Factory pattern: This pattern allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This makes it easy to switch out implementations without affecting the rest of your code.
Flyweight pattern: This pattern allows you to reduce the memory usage of an application by sharing common data among multiple objects, rather than storing the same data in each object individually. This is often used in Rails to optimize the performance of applications that deal with large amounts of data.
Interpreter pattern: This pattern allows you to define a language and provide an interpreter for it, making it easy to process structured data in a flexible way. This is often used in Rails to provide a simple, domain-specific language for defining complex queries or other operations.
Iterator pattern: This pattern allows you to access the elements of a collection sequentially, without exposing the underlying representation. This is often used in Rails to provide a consistent way of working with collections of data.
Mediator pattern: This pattern allows you to define a central object that coordinates the interactions between other objects, reducing the complexity of the interactions and making it easier to maintain the code. This is often used in Rails to manage communication between different components of an application.
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern: This pattern divides an application into three main components: the model, which manages the data and business logic; the view, which is responsible for displaying the user interface; and the controller, which handles incoming requests and coordinates the interaction between the model and view.
Observer pattern: This pattern allows you to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Prototype pattern: This pattern allows you to create new objects by cloning an existing prototype, rather than creating them from scratch. This is often used in Rails to quickly create new objects that have similar characteristics to existing ones.
Proxy pattern: This pattern allows you to create an object that acts as a substitute for another object, providing the same interface but with different behavior. This is often used in Rails to provide additional functionality or to optimize the performance of an application.
Service pattern: This pattern is used to implement the business logic of an application, separating it from the other components and making it easier to manage and maintain.
Singleton pattern: This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class can be created, making it easy to manage global state in your application.
State pattern: This pattern allows an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. This is often used in Rails to implement state-based behavior in models or controllers.
Strategy pattern: This pattern allows you to define a set of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, and to switch between them at runtime. This is often used in Rails to provide different ways of handling a particular task, such as sorting data or rendering a view.
Template pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide the details. This is often used in Rails to provide a common structure for generating views or other output.
Visitor pattern: This pattern allows you to define a new operation for a class without modifying the class itself. This is often used in Rails to add new behavior to existing models or other components without modifying their code.
