## Composition

Composition is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class is made up of other classes. This allows for code reuse and flexibility, as a class can be composed of multiple classes that each have their own specific functionality. For example, a Car class can be composed of a Wheel class, an Engine class, and a Door class, each with their own methods and attributes. This allows the Car class to have all of the functionality of its composed classes without having to duplicate code.
