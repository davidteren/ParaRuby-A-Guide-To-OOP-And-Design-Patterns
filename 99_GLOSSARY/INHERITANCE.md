## Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit characteristics and behavior from another class. This allows for code to be organized into a hierarchy of classes, where common behavior and attributes can be defined in a base class and then inherited by subclasses. This allows for code to be more reusable and maintainable, as subclasses can easily inherit and extend the behavior of their parent class. For example, a Vehicle class might define common attributes and behavior for all vehicles, such as a speed attribute and a move method. Then, specific types of vehicles, such as Car and Bike, could inherit from Vehicle and define their own unique behavior.

> Inheritance is like when you have a big family and you all have the same last name. For example, your mom and dad might be the "parents" and you and your brothers and sisters are the "kids". You all have the same last name because you all come from the same family. This is inheritance because you all have the same thing (the last name) because you come from the same place (the family). So when someone says your last name, they know you're part of the same family. It's like a magic word that tells people where you come from.
