# Inversion of Control

Inversion of control is a design principle in object-oriented programming where the flow of control is inverted compared to traditional procedural programming. In traditional programming, the code tells the program what to do, but in inversion of control, the program tells the code what to do. This is often achieved through the use of design patterns such as the factory pattern and the dependency injection pattern. Inversion of control allows for more modular and flexible code, as it decouples the different components of a program and allows them to be easily replaced or extended.

> Inversion of control is like having a teacher who tells you what to do instead of you telling the teacher what to do. The teacher gives you a bunch of different things to do, and you can choose which ones you want to do and in what order. This way, you can learn and do lots of different things, and the teacher can help you when you need it. It's a lot more fun and interesting than just following the same old rules all the time.
