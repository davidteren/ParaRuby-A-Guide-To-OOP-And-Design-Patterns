# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or message in different ways. This allows for objects to be treated uniformly, regardless of their specific type or class. For example, a collection of shapes (circles, squares, triangles, etc.) can all respond to the same area method, but each will calculate the area differently based on its specific type. This allows for code to be more reusable and maintainable, as new types of objects can be easily added without having to change existing code.

> Polymorphism is like being able to use the same word to mean different things. For example, if you have a bunch of toys, some of them might be cars and some of them might be trucks. But you can still call all of them "toys" because they all do the same thing: they're things that you can play with. This is polymorphism because you can use the same word for many different things. It's like a magic word that can mean different things depending on what you're talking about.
