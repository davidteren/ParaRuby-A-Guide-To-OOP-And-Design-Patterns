# Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary details or complexities from a system or concept in order to focus on the essential characteristics or functionality. This allows for a more general or high-level view of the system or concept, which makes it easier to understand and manipulate. Abstraction is often used in computer science, where it is applied to various levels of a system, from the design and implementation of algorithms and data structures, to the design and use of software interfaces.

> Abstraction is like taking a really big thing and making it smaller and simpler. For example, if you have a really big box with lots of different things inside, you can take all the things out and put them in smaller boxes that are labeled with what's inside. This makes it easier to find the things you want, and you don't have to dig through the big box to find them. Abstraction is like organizing things into smaller, simpler parts.
