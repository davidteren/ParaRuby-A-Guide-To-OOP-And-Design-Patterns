# Paradigms of Ruby: A Guide to Object-Oriented Programming

A paradigm is a way of thinking or a framework for understanding something. In the field of computer science, a paradigm refers to a set of concepts, practices, and assumptions that define a particular approach to solving problems. Examples of paradigms in computer science include object-oriented programming, functional programming, and procedural programming. These paradigms have different approaches to organizing code and solving problems, and they are often used to solve different types of problems or in different contexts.

> A paradigm is a big idea or framework that helps us understand something. It's like a set of rules or a way of thinking that helps us solve problems and make sense of things. In the world of computers, a paradigm is a way of thinking about how to write programs and solve problems using computers. For example, object-oriented programming is a paradigm that teaches us how to organize our code and think about solving problems in a certain way. Paradigms help us understand how to write programs and solve problems in different programming languages, like Ruby.
