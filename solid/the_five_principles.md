# What is SOLID

**SOLID** is an acronym for five principles of [object-oriented programming (OOP)](../oop.md) that are designed to improve the design and maintainability of software. The principles are:

1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](01\_single\_responsibility\_principle.md): A class should only have a single responsibility, or a single reason to change.
2. [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](02\_open\_closed\_principle.md): A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](03\_liskov\_substitution\_principle.md): Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
4. [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](04\_interface\_segregation\_principle.md): Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](05\_dependency\_inversion\_principle.md): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

These principles help to promote code that is more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

> #### Explain SOLID like I'm five
>
> SOLID is like a house. A house is made up of different parts, like walls and windows and doors. And even though the walls and windows and doors are all different, they all work together to make a nice, strong house.
>
> * The S in SOLID stands for Single Responsibility Principle, which is like a person who only has one job to do. For example, one person might be responsible for painting the walls, and another person might be responsible for fixing the windows. And even though they have different jobs, they can still work together to make the house look nice.
> * The O in SOLID stands for Open/Closed Principle, which is like a box that you can put things in, but you can't change the box itself.
> * The L in SOLID stands for Liskov Substitution Principle, which is like a game of hide and seek that different people can play together.
> * The I in SOLID stands for Interface Segregation Principle, which is like a toolbox with different tools for different jobs.
> * And the D in SOLID stands for Dependency Inversion Principle, which is like a toy robot that can use other things to help it do the things it wants to do.
